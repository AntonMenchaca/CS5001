# Module 1: Python Variables, Variable Assignment, Arithmetic Expressions, and Concatenation

Welcome to **Module 1** of the CS5001 course! In this module, we will cover the basics of Python, focusing on variables, arithmetic expressions, and string concatenation. By the end of this module, you will be able to create and manipulate variables, perform basic arithmetic, and concatenate strings in Python.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Module 1, you will be able to:
1. Understand how to create **variables** in Python.
2. Perform **arithmetic operations** using Python's operators.
3. Use **string concatenation** to join strings together.
4. Write Python code to solve basic problems involving variables and arithmetic.

## Key Topics

1. **Python Variables**: Learn how to create variables to store data such as numbers and strings.
2. **Variable Assignment**: Assign values to variables and understand how to change their values.
3. **Arithmetic Expressions**: Use operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` to perform arithmetic on numbers.
4. **String Concatenation**: Combine strings using the `+` operator.
