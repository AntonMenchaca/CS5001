# Module 2: Boolean Expressions, Conditional Statements, Nested `if`, Multiway Conditionals, and Logical Operators

Welcome to **Module 2** of the CS5001 course! In this module, we will explore how to use conditional logic in Python, including Boolean expressions, conditional statements (`if` and `else`), nested conditionals, multiway conditionals (`elif`), and logical operators. These concepts are crucial for controlling the flow of a program based on various conditions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Module 2, you will be able to:
1. Write **Boolean expressions** to evaluate conditions.
2. Use **conditional statements** to control program flow based on conditions.
3. Implement **nested `if` statements** to handle more complex conditions.
4. Write **multiway conditionals** using `if`, `elif`, and `else` for multiple decision paths.
5. Apply **logical operators** to combine multiple conditions.

## Key Topics

1. **Boolean Expressions**: Create expressions that evaluate to `True` or `False` using comparison operators.
2. **Conditional Statements**: Use `if` and `else` to control program execution based on conditions.
3. **Nested `if` Statements**: Create `if` statements inside other `if` statements to check more specific conditions.
4. **Multiway Conditionals**: Use `elif` to create multiple conditions to check in sequence.
5. **Logical Operators**: Combine multiple Boolean expressions using `and`, `or`, and `not`.
